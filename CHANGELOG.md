Unreleased in the same PR.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `docket init`: a wizard that sets up a vault anywhere, or nested in a working folder that is its own git repo, with
  an optional private remote.
- The vault's raw log: records written once per source and run, deduplicated, committed locally.
- `docket vault status` and `docket vault check`.
- The staging gate: every record reaches the raw log through it. Never-store lists and private sources drop records
  without a trace, mixed sources wait to be classified, and credentials, keys and phone numbers are redacted.
- `docket staging list`, `show`, `classify` (work or private, with cuts) and `promote`.
- Processed docs with anchors: `docket doc put` stores a summary only when every line points at raw that exists, and
  keeps each change as a revision; `docket doc read` and `docket doc verify` show a doc or a record next to its raw.
- `docket search`: full-text search over everything kept, in English and your other languages, with names, aliases,
  time words and boosts; hits come grouped by recording or thread, with their locators and summaries.
- `docket index rebuild | update | status`: the search index on each machine, built from the vault.
- Entity files under `entities/`: names, aliases and ids that search matches into everything kept.
